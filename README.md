Little project to practise html, css, js, php, mysql

# Info
If you want to test it out for yourself you need to do the following changes:
+ the templates folder can be deleted
+ in the sql folder you find an phpmyadmin export of the database
+ in the 'public/.htaccess' change the 'RewriteBase' if necessary
+ in the 'app/config/config.php' change the 'DB params' and the other defs if necessary

If you have any questions feel free to contact me!
